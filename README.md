# Anti-Spoofing Deep Learning Project

Welcome to the "Anti-Spoofing Deep Learning Project." This project focuses on developing a deep learning solution to detect and prevent spoofing attempts, enhancing security and authenticity in various applications.

## Project Components

- `data/`: Contains the necessary data files for training and testing the anti-spoofing model.

- `Dataset.py`: Python script for creating custom datasets and data preprocessing.

- `Model.py`: Implementation of the deep learning model for anti-spoofing.

- `Train.py`: Script for training the anti-spoofing model.

- `haarface.xml`: Haar Cascade classifier for face detection.

- `test_data.csv`: Dataset containing test data and labels.

- `train_data.csv`: Dataset containing training data and labels.

- `weights.pth`: Pre-trained model weights.

- `paper1.pdf`: Reference paper 1 for background and related work.

- `paper2.pdf`: Reference paper 2 for project methodology and findings.

## Project Overview

This project addresses the critical issue of spoofing attempts in various applications, such as facial recognition and biometric authentication. The deep learning model leverages the data and resources provided in this repository to detect and prevent spoofing attempts effectively.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Python packages and dependencies as specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

3. Use the provided data and model files to train or test the anti-spoofing model.

4. Customize the model or data preprocessing as needed for your specific use case.

## Usage

- Run `Train.py` to train the anti-spoofing model.

- Use the pre-trained model weights in `weights.pth` for inference or deployment.

- Refer to the reference papers for a deeper understanding of the project's background and methodology.
